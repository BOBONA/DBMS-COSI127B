# IMDB Clone
This IMDB clone offers groundbreaking features such as (but not limited to): 
- A search bar
- A "fully functioning" like button
- The ability to filter movies by the zipcode of their shooting location (you didn't know you needed this until now)
- A way to search for movies rated better than the average comedy
- A dedicated button for fetching the top 2 rated thriller movies that were shot _exclusively_ in Boston 

In our endeavors, we created a sad excuse for a query builder and 
entirely abstracted away our input forms in order to feel like we were using React.
